  Figure 1: The concept of BEL. d = predictor (observed data), h = target (parameter of interest), m = model.

- The idea of BEL is to find a direct relationship between `d` (predictor) and `h` (target) in a reduced dimensional space with machine learning.
- Both `d` and `h` are generated by forward modelling from the same set of prior models `m`.
- Given a new measured predictor `d*`, this relationship is used to infer the posterior probability distribution of the target, without the need for a computationally expensive inversion. 
- The posterior distribution of the target is then sampled and backtransformed from the reduced dimensional space to the original space to predict posterior realizations of `h` given `d*`.
