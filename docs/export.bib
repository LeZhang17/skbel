   abstract = {<p>The non-uniqueness of the solution of inverse geophysical problem has been recognized for a long-time. Although stochastic inversion methods have been developed, deterministic inversion using subsequent regularization is still more widely applied. This is likely due to their efficiency and robustness, compared to the computationally expensive and sometimes difficult to tune to convergence stochastic methods. Recently, Bayesian evidential learning 1-D imaging has been presented to the community as a viable tool for the efficient stochastic 1-D imaging of the subsurface based on geophysical data. The method has been proven to be as fast, or sometimes even faster, than deterministic solution. However, the method has a significant drawback when dealing with large prior uncertainty as often encountered in geophysical surveys: it tends to overestimate the uncertainty range. In this paper, we provide an efficient way to overcome this limitation through iterative prior resampling (IPR) followed by rejection sampling. IPR adds the posterior distribution calculated at a former iteration to the prior distribution in a subsequent iteration. This allows to sharpen the learning phase of the algorithm and improve the estimation of the final posterior distribution while rejection sampling eliminates models not fitting the data. In this contribution, we demonstrate that this new approach allows BEL1D to converge towards the true posterior distribution. We also analyse the convergence behaviour of the algorithm and derive guidelines for its application. We apply the approach for the interpretation of surface waves dispersion curves but the approach can be generalized to other geophysical methods.</p>},

   abstract = {Groundwater management practices, such as sustainable drinking water extraction or contamination protection, can have significant socioeconomic impacts. A complete uncertainty analysis should ideally be performed to anticipate all possible outcomes and assess any risk. Uncertainties arise as a result of our limited understanding of the physical processes involved, as well as a scarcity of measurement data, whether directly or indirectly related to the physical parameters of interest. In this paper, we use a small number of tracing experiments (predictor) to predict the wellhead protection area (WHPA, target), the shape and extent of which are influenced by the distribution of hydraulic conductivity (K). Our first goal is to make stochastic predictions of the WHPA within the Bayesian Evidential Learning (BEL) framework, which uses machine learning to find a direct relationship between predictor and target. This relationship is learned using a small number of training models (400) drawn from the prior distribution of K. Forward modelling is used to obtain the 400 pairs of simulated predictors and targets. Newly collected field data can then be used directly to predict the approximate posterior distribution of the corresponding WHPA, obviating the need for the traditional step of data inversion. The number and location of data sources (injection wells) influence the posterior WHPA distribution's uncertainty range. Our second goal is to extend BEL to determine the optimal design of data source locations that minimises the WHPA's posterior uncertainty. Because the BEL model, once trained, allows the computation of the posterior uncertainty corresponding to any new input data, experimental design can be done explicitly, without averaging or approximating. We estimate the WHPA's posterior uncertainty range using the Modified Hausdorff Distance (MHD) and Structural Similarity (SSIM) index metrics. Because the breakthrough curves store information on a large area of the K field surrounding the pumping well, increasing the number of injection wells reduces the derived posterior WHPA uncertainty. Our method can also estimate which injection wells are more informative than others, as demonstrated by a k-fold cross-validation procedure. Overall, the application of BEL to experimental design allows for identi fying data sources that maximise the information content of any measurement data while keeping budget constraints and computational costs to a minimum.},

abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been increasingly looking like a promising strategy to reduce CO2 emissions and meet the Paris agreement’s climate target. To ensure that CCS is safe and successful, an efficient monitoring program that will prevent storage reservoir leakage and drinking water contamination in groundwater aquifers must be implemented. However, geologic CO2 sequestration (GCS) sites are not completely certain about the geological properties, which makes it difficult to predict the behavior of the injected gases, CO2 brine leakage rates through wellbores, and CO2 plume migration. Significant effort is required to observe how CO2 behaves in reservoirs. A key question is: Will the CO2 injection and storage behave as expected, and can we anticipate leakages? History matching of reservoir models can mitigate uncertainty towards a predictive strategy. It could prove challenging to develop a set of history matching models that preserve geological realism. A new Bayesian evidential learning (BEL) protocol for uncertainty quantification was released through literature, as an alternative to the model-space inversion in the history-matching approach. Consequently, an ensemble of previous geological models was developed using a prior distribution’s Monte Carlo simulation, followed by direct forecasting (DF) for joint uncertainty quantification. The goal of this work is to use prior models to identify a statistical relationship between data prediction, ensemble models, and data variables, without any explicit model inversion. The paper also introduces a new DF implementation using an ensemble smoother and shows that the new implementation can make the computation more robust than the standard method. The Utsira saline aquifer west of Norway is used to exemplify BEL’s ability to predict the CO2 mass and leakages and improve decision support regarding CO2 storage projects.},

   abstract = {Geological uncertainty quantification is critical to subsurface modeling and prediction, such as groundwater, oil or gas, and geothermal resources, and needs to be continuously updated with new data. We provide an automated method for uncertainty quantification and the updating of geological models using borehole data for subsurface developments within a Bayesian framework. Our methodologies are developed with the Bayesian evidential learning protocol for uncertainty quantification. Under such a framework, newly acquired borehole data directly and jointly update geological models (structure, lithology, petrophysics, and fluids), globally and spatially, without time-consuming model rebuilding. To address the above matters, an ensemble of prior geological models is first constructed by Monte Carlo simulation from prior distribution. Once the prior model is tested by means of a falsification process, a sequential direct forecasting is designed to perform the joint uncertainty quantification. The direct forecasting is a statistical learning method that learns from a series of bijective operations to establish "Bayes-linear-Gauss" statistical relationships between model and data variables. Such statistical relationships, once conditioned to actual borehole measurements, allow for fast-computation posterior geological models. The proposed framework is completely automated in an open-source project. We demonstrate its application by applying it to a generic gas reservoir dataset. The posterior results show significant uncertainty reduction in both spatial geological model and gas volume prediction and cannot be falsified by new borehole observations. Furthermore, our automated framework completes the entire uncertainty quantification process efficiently for such large models.},

   abstract = {Imaging the subsurface of the Earth is of prime concern in geosciences. In this scope, geophysics offers a wide range of methods that are able to produce models of the subsurface, classically through inversion processes. Deterministic inversions lack the ability to produce satisfactory quantifications of uncertainty, whereas stochastic inversions are often computationally demanding. In this paper, a new method to interpret geophysical data is proposed in order to produce 1D imaging of the subsurface along with the uncertainty on the associated parameters. This new approach called Bayesian Evidential Learning 1D imaging (BEL1D) relies on the constitution of statistics-based relationships between simulated data and associated model parameters. The method is applied to surface nuclear magnetic resonance for both a numerical example and field data. The obtained results are compared to the solutions provided by other approaches for the interpretation of these datasets, to demonstrate the robustness of BEL1D. Although this contribution demonstrates the framework for surface nuclear magnetic resonance geophysical data, it is not restricted to this type of data but can be applied to any 1D inverse problem.},

The theoretical framework we develop allows incorporation of non-linear statistical models for seismic estimation problems.

With the help of a synthetic example of estimation of reservoir net-to-gross and average fluid saturations in sub-resolution thin sand reservoir, several nuances are foregrounded regarding the applicability of unsupervised and supervised learning methods for seismic estimation problems.

The recovered water content models are obtained through the solution of an ill-posed inverse problem that is a function of acquisition parameters, including location and shape of the transmitter and receiver coils. In this paper, we introduce the multi-central-loop acquisition and inversion strategy where one or several smaller receivers coils are placed in the center of the larger transmitter loop and where all the data sets synchronously recorded through each loop are inverted simultaneously. We investigate the attributes of this acquisition and inversion strategy including the ability to provide improved resolution, accuracy and reduced uncertainty on the estimated subsurface models compared to single channel acquisition methods. Using widely-adopted inversion methods and introducing a new data interpretation technique called Bayesian Evidential Learning 1D imaging, we show that the multi-central-loop configuration provides improved recovery of synthetic models and reduced levels of inverted parameter uncertainty. A field case is also presented where the multi-central-loop results appear to better match the lithologic knowledge of the area compared with single channel configurations, again providing smaller uncertainties.},

   abstract = {Direct forecasting has recently been proposed as a method for uncertainty quantification in non-linear inverse problems. The method directly forecasts a desired future response without the need for full model inversion. The method has been successfully applied to a range of subsurface field cases, such as groundwater, shallow and deep geothermal and oil/gas predictions. In this paper, we extend the framework of direct forecasting to do what it was avoided to do in the first place: model inversion. The idea is simple: replace the prediction variables with the model variables. Two challenges now occur: the model dimensions, in subsurface realm at least, are much higher than data variables. This is the case in the paper where we consider dynamic data and high-dimensional spatial models for geological structure and properties. Secondly, the regression applied in the original method, being a linear regression of prediction variables on transformed data, is unlikely to lead to models that match field observations. We address these challenges first by adding a variable selection method (through global sensitivity analysis) for the model space. More specifically, we select those model components that are most sensitive to data variables only. The linear assumption is mitigated by a sequential updating of sensitive model variables. We illustrate our method on a Libyan oil reservoir with complex geological uncertainty involving structural, petrophysical and fluid model parameters.},

Due to the cost of drilling, there is often large uncertainty in the prediction of resource potential as well as challenges in optimizing well placement. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive Bayesian framework that accounts for high degrees of geologic uncertainty. Although Bayesian inference methods for prediction and uncertainty quantification are well-established, limitations exist, such as incorporating model realism and reducing the computational burden of simulating a large number of forward models. Using a case study problem, we demonstrate how to turn geologic understanding into a prior probability model for a basin-scale extensional geothermal system. We then use the proposed Bayesian framework, called Bayesian Evidential Learning, to generate posterior temperature predictions constrained to a temperature well without any explicit model inversion. In this approach, the relationship between data and prediction variables is learned by Canonical Correlation Analysis of a training set of models generated by Monte Carlo simulation. Sensitivity analysis results show that temperature in a geothermal target area is most sensitive to the bulk permeability of the basement and basin rock as well as the basal heat flux.},

In practice, the energy efficiency is often lower than expected from simulations due to spatial heterogeneity of hydraulic properties or non-favorable hydrogeological conditions. A proper design of ATES systems should therefore consider the uncertainty of the prediction related to those parameters. We use a novel framework called Bayesian Evidential Learning (BEL) to estimate the heat storage capacity of an alluvial aquifer using a heat tracing experiment. BEL is based on two main stages: pre- and postfield data acquisition. Before data acquisition, Monte Carlo simulations and global sensitivity analysis are used to assess the information content of the data to reduce the uncertainty of the prediction. After data acquisition, prior falsification and machine learning based on the same Monte Carlo are used to directly assess uncertainty on key prediction variables from observations. The result is a full quantification of the posterior distribution of the prediction conditioned to observed data, without any explicit full model inversion. We demonstrate the methodology in field conditions and validate the framework using independent measurements.},

However, the quantitative interpretation of tomograms in terms of physical properties, such as salinity, temperature or saturation, remains difficult. In many applications, geophysical models are transformed into hydrological models, but this transformation suffers from spatially and temporally varying resolution resulting from the regularization used by the deterministic inversion. In this study, we investigate a prediction-focused approach (PFA) to directly estimate subsurface physical properties with electrical resistance data, circumventing the need for classic tomographic inversions. First, we generate a prior set of resistance data and physical property forecast through hydrogeological and geophysical simulations mimicking the field experiment. We reduce the dimension of both the data and the forecast through principal component analysis in order to keep the most informative part of both sets in a reduced dimension space. Then, we apply canonical correlation analysis to explore the relationship between the data and the forecast in their reduced dimension space. If a linear relationship can be established, the posterior distribution of the forecast can be directly sampled using a Gaussian process regression where the field data scores are the conditioning data. In this paper, we demonstrate PFA for various physical property distributions. We also develop a framework to propagate the estimated noise level in the reduced dimension space. We validate the results by a Monte Carlo study on the posterior distribution and demonstrate that PFA yields accurate uncertainty for the cases studied.},

However, full inverse modeling can be time-consuming requiring iteration over a high dimensional parameter space with computationally expensive forward models and complex spatial priors. In this paper, we investigate a prediction-focused approach (PFA) that aims at building a statistical relationship between data variables and forecast variables, avoiding the inversion of model parameters altogether. The statistical relationship is built by first applying the forward model related to the data variables and the forward model related to the prediction variables on a limited set of spatial prior models realizations, typically generated through geostatistical methods. The relationship observed between data and prediction is highly non-linear for many forecasting problems in the subsurface. In this paper we propose a Canonical Functional Component Analysis (CFCA) to map the data and forecast variables into a low-dimensional space where, if successful, the relationship is linear. CFCA consists of (1) functional principal component analysis (FPCA) for dimension reduction of time-series data and (2) canonical correlation analysis (CCA); the latter aiming to establish a linear relationship between data and forecast components. If such mapping is successful, then we illustrate with several cases that (1) simple regression techniques with a multi-Gaussian framework can be used to directly quantify uncertainty on the forecast without any model inversion and that (2) such uncertainty is a good approximation of uncertainty obtained from full posterior sampling with rejection sampling.},
